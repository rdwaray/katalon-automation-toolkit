# Simple Regex Keyword Tool

A simple tool to convert your script using predefined regex patterns.  
Built with Python and PyInstaller.  


## Description

It uses predefined regex patterns based on my **custom keywords**.


## How to Use
1. **Copy my custom keyword folder** into your project.
2. **Prepare your script** inside `input.txt` (place it in the same folder as the `.exe`).
3. **Run** `regex.exe`.
4. **Check** the `output.txt` for the converted result.


## Customization
